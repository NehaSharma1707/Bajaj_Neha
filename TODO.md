# TODO List for Implementing REST APIs and Full HTML Page

- [x] Initialize Node.js project with npm init -y
- [x] Install dependencies: express and @google/generative-ai
- [x] Create server.js with server setup and API endpoints:
  - [x] POST /bfhl: Handle fibonacci, prime, lcm, hcf, AI logic with validation and error handling
  - [x] GET /health: Return health status
  - [x] Integrate Google Gemini for AI responses
- [x] Update index.html to full page with:
  - [x] Forms for each API input (fibonacci, prime, lcm, hcf, AI)
  - [x] JavaScript to fetch and display responses
  - [x] Styling for a complete webpage
- [x] Test locally: Run server and interact via HTML (health endpoint verified)
- [ ] Prepare for deployment: Ensure environment variables for API key
- [ ] Deploy to a platform (e.g., Vercel) and share links
